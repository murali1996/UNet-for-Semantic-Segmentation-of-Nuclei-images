Learning Outcomes

- CLAHE & MORPHOLOGICAL OPERATIONS: Adaptive thresholding using openCV, DIlations, Erosion, Closing, Opening, Connected Componnents using BFS

- Difference between "Conv2DTranspose" and "UpSampling2D" used in Keras. ALthough both increase the input dimension, they vary in the sstrategy in upsampling

Explorations:
- UNet
- SegNet
- DilatedNet
- LinkNet


Yet to learn:
- How good will CNN learn different colored stains if i donot do stain normalization??


Latest APproach:
- See model details in unet file
- First, data extracted by augmentation through patches and random flips, rotations and model is then trained.
- In this, batch size is 16


## Seems like this way, loss isn't improving and moreover, its overfitting'
## Secondly, each image is resized to 256*256 and two times, a random set of operations were performed on each image and trained
## In this, batch size is 8

**Yet to try
- Befor eevry epoch, new data is generated. With more data of coloured elements being generated!
